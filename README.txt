do whatever you want with the code.
also look at the 2nd line in the code if you want to change the directory the program uses
if you are a chromebook go to repl.it and paste in the code


if you somehow feel in debt to me please answer my questions at ethienduckett@outlook.com and follow

if you are using rpath = open("message.txt", "r").read() does this open message.txt every time I call rpath?
how do I even use github?
how do I make a windows and linux branch?
would a person use a bash program that opens the python file without you having to manually open it in the terminal?
